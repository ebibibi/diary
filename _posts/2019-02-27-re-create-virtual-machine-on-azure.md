Recently, I didn't upgrade my vm hosting many my wordpress sites for long time.

Today, I kick apt-get update and apt-get upgrade and vm got crashed due to many package dependency.

I use debian for over 20 years. It is extremely stable. this issue is my fault not fault by debian.

there are many problems, I decided to create new vm on Azure IaaS by using my MVP benefit.

You are seeing my new wordpress site on new vm on Azure now. Even though, content is same.
