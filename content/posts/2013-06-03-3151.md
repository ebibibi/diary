My son had a fever from Saturday night. He was not fine all day on Sunday. On Monday's morning, his temperature was little bit higher than usual but I thought he will be fine soon. So I went to my office though he scream out.

My wife took him to a hospital and a doctor discovered my son's blood-sugar level was low. It was 50. A doctor recommended to take him to a city-run hospital.

He went to a city-run hospital and got drip infusion, then he became fine. When I arrived to the hostipal, he was sleeping and my youngest daughter was sleeping at the same bed too. When I saw these peaceful sleeping faces, I felt easy.

This time I didn't feel need to take him to a hospital, so I really feel thank to my wife.
